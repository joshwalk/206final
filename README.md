I wrote a program that gathers my 100 most recent Facebook page likes and organizes them by day. This data is cached and stored in a SQLite database. A simple bar graph visualiation is built from the database and shows the likes organized by day of week.

Languages/tools used: Python, JSON, SQLite, Plotly
